# React_Basics_

Why should you learn React?

Because it's the most popular and most efficient Javascript library.

Among Javascript developers, React has been in the lead for 6 years.

React.js is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and the open-source
community. React.js is a phenomenal library that is easy to understand, has excellent cross-platform support, has a fantastic community, and is one of the most loved libraries out there.

Basic things to learn in React.js:

File & Folder structure
- Components
- JSX
- Props
- State
- Events
- Styling
- Conditional Rendering


Learn about React.js Hooks - the essential hooks to learn:

useState
useEffect
useRef
useContext
useReducer
useMemo
useCallback

Components
React.js Concepts

React JS is a component-based front-end library which means that all parts of a web application are divided into small components.

A component is a small piece of the User interface. Every React.js application is a tree of components.

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable parts. So when you're building an application with React, you'll build independent and reusable components, and then you'll combine them to build a full fledged web application.

JSX - JavaScript XML

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React . JSX forms the core syntax of React..

What are Props?

To make our components accept different data, we can use props. Props are arguments passed into React components. They are passed to  components via HTML attributes.

Props is just a shorter way of saying Properties.

We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to child components), But you can't pass props
from a child component to parent components. Data from props is read-only and cannot be modified by a component receiving it from outside.

What is State?

A State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent a piece of information about the component's current situation. It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).

The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

What is Events?

An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or a system-generated event. For example, a mouse click, pressing a key, and other interactions are called events.

Handling events with React elements is similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are just some syntax differences.

React events are named using camelCase,
rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event
handler, rather than a string.

What are React.js Hooks?

Hooks are a new addition to React in version 16.8 that allows you to use state and other React features, like lifecycle methods. Using hooks makes your code cleaner.

Hooks don't work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes. Hooks let you always use functions instead of having. to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.

Nowadays, hooks are widely used. So you should start using it as well. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.
